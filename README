INSTALL
	perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make install;
	Do 'make install' as root if installing into root-protected directories
Description
	This a framework for building shells and commands around user-defined functions and
	libraries.
Features
	-subclassable: all functions are defined as class methods making this module easily subclassable
	-libraries: load libraries of functions automatically, libraries can come with default global data
	-data: user-configurable variables defined as global data and are highly configurable
	at several levels( global config file,library defaults,library config file,script and
	commandline)
	-options: can be called from commandline or shell to pass values to global data and any functions
	-basic metadata functions: set and print global data,listing of functions  
	-integrated help: supports defining description and usage help for user-defined functions, 
	-alias shell functions
	-parsing modes: can change how current line is parsed on the fly by flipping the parsing option, comes
	with a handy parse_menu parse mode
	- should work with any database working under Class::DBI; verified to work with
	  Mysql,Postgres and Sqlite.
ToDo
	- Redesign to allow plugin architecture for loading data, readline, storing
	data, printing data. By making any external modules plugins, one can
	have a minimal shell and install external modules as desired.
	- support libraries which have object methods, currently only class methods supported  
	- autocompletion support
	- make design more OO: suggestions welcome :) 
	- better library plugin support
